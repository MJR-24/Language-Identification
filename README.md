# Language-Identification
This repository hosts a Language Identification model designed to automatically detect the language of a given text sample. Language identification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications ranging from text classification to multilingual support in software applications.

Key Features:
- Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in identifying the language of text samples, making it reliable for various NLP tasks.
- Multilingual Support: It supports detection of a wide range of languages, allowing for robust handling of multilingual text data.
- Scalability: The model is designed to scale efficiently, enabling rapid processing of large volumes of text data.
- Customization: It can be easily adapted and fine-tuned to specific domains or language varieties as needed.
- Easy Integration: The model can be seamlessly integrated into existing NLP pipelines or applications using common frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Usage:
- Training: Train the model using labeled text data to customize it for specific requirements or languages.
- Inference: Use the trained model to predict the language of text samples in real-time or batch processing scenarios.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
